# Country Search

### Check out the [LIVE DEMO](https://d-0-t-country-search.netlify.app/)! ❤️

## Three GitHub branches (Switch for other versions!)
- [State handling with **useState()**](https://github.com/d-0-t/integrify-countries/tree/master)
- [State handling with **Redux**](https://github.com/d-0-t/integrify-countries/tree/redux)
- [Converted project to **TypeScript**](https://github.com/d-0-t/integrify-countries/tree/typescript)

### Utilized features:
- [RestCountries](https://restcountries.com/#api-endpoints-v3-name) API fetching
- React.js framework
- State handling with Redux (and previously useState)
- Late TypeScript conversion of existing project
- Implementation of functional components
- Bug/crash fixes
- Performance optimization (prevent rerender)
- "Cart" functionality (a bit nonsense in this context, but it was a requirement, see proper context in my [Fake Store](https://github.com/d-0-t/integrify-webstore) project)


## Original React assignment instructions (from Integrify)

Do the assignment as shown in the demo. reference the below image for design.
Also create a functional search bar, which will search for the countries.
